# Recommender-System
 Almost all the applications we use today rely extensively on recommender systems to build user profilesand accordingly recommend items to buy/watch/read that matches their users’ interests.
 In this project, I built a recommender system that uses the users’ purchases history to:
 
 •Recommend an item to the user based on their previous purchases if the current cart is empty
 
 •If there are items already added to the users cart, recommend an item to the user based on theirprevious purchases and the current items in the cart
 
 •Another option is to recommend an item to the user based on the intersection between the itemsthey previously purchased and other users’ purchases

You will find a mini-database at the begining of the project
